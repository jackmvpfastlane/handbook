## Steve Jobs

> "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. 
> Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. 
> Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice."
      
> "And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
> They some how already know what you truly want. 
> Everything else is secondary."
    
> "Stay hungry, stay foolish."

## Kobe Bryant

Talents alone won't get it done.

Kobe woke up earlier and trained harder than everyone else even as the best players in NBA.

This is the kind of intensity that we admire, and we work insanely hard to achieve greatness.


## Iwata Satoru 

Mr. Iwata is former president and CEO of Nintendo.
We think he is an example of perfect combination of engineer and business executive.
