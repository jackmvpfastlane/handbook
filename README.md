# MVP Employee Handbook

This handbook articulates who we are as a company.
What is our mission? What we stand for? How should we work to achieve our mission?
This handbook brings some clarity to the important questions above.

Our handbook is public and all revision history is version-controlled.
Honesty is in our core values. 
And by making this handbook public, anyone can see if we actually do what we said we do. 

Revision history is important because the world is changing very fast ans so should we.
By keeping the history visible to everyone at the company, we can get a better understanding
of where we came from. 
And most importantly, we can always improve what we actually do constantly. 

Everyone at the company is encouraged to constantly check this handbook, think and question about
things. We will keep improving ourselves and the company as well.
